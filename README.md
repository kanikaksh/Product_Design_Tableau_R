# Product Design using  Tableau & R

Marketing researchers have done a lot of work to find and analyze the success of new product concepts before they are launched. This interest has been fueled most by consumer preference-based techniques such as conjoint analysis and multidimensional scaling (Kohli and Krishnamurti, 1987).
According to Kohli and Krishnamurti (1987), the proposed heuristic significantly outperforms a competing Lagrangian relaxation heuristic when simulating real problems in terms of processing time and best solution approximation. Laptops are designed in a way that can satisfy every desire of the consumers according to their defined set of preferences Shiau et al. (2007). Both laptop designers and users can benefit from a better understanding of these choices and preferences. Shiau et al. (2007)

This report aims to solve the challenge of designing a new laptop by identifying the right features of the product by analysing customersâ€™ preferences and deriving the value associated with each attribute to increasing profitability and market share using conjoint analysis and principal component analysis.
